# This implements a fairly simple multi-window buffer.
#
# When included, a thread is created that will listen to stdin and feed the
# input to whichever window is active.
#
# New instances of this class are created to create new windows. The window can
# be switched by calling the activate() or deactivate() functions.
#
# Windows are set up like a tree - when you create a window, you can specify a
# 'parent'. When a window is deactivated or closed, the parent is activated (if
# possible).  Typically, you'll want one "master" window, which is the top-most
# window in the tree.
#
# User input is handled by a callback function. The proc that handles user
# input is passed to the on_input() function (which allows it to be changed),
# and it's called each time the user presses <enter>.
#
# The window can be printed to using fairly normal functions - puts, printf,
# print, etc.
#
# Windows are assigned an incremental ID value, and can be referred to as such.
#
# If you want a message to go to a window's parents (or children), a special
# function called with() can be used with a block:
#
# window.with({:to_parent => true}) do
#   window.puts("hi")
# end
#
# The following options can be set:
# * :to_parent - sends to the current window and its parent
# * :to_ancestors - sends to the current window, its parent, its parent's parent, etc.
# * :to_children - Sends to the current window, and each of its children
# * :to_descendants - Sends to the current window, its children, its children's children, etc.
#
# Each window also maintains a history of typed comments, up to 1000 lines (by default).
