 *
 * This module implements a simple interface to the select() function that
 * works across Windows, Linux, BSD, and Mac. Any (reasonable) number of
 * sockets can be added and when any one of them has data, callbacks are used
 * to notify the main program.
 *
 * This library is single-threaded (except on Windows.. I'll get to that). I've
 * compiled and tested it on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac, and Windows, and it works
 * beautifully on all of them. On any of those platforms it can select just
 * fine on stream sockets, datagram sockets, listeners, and pipes (including
 * stdin on Windows).
 *
 * Windows support for pipes is a special case. Because Windows can't select()
 * on a pipe or HANDLE, I had to implement some special code. Basically, it
 * polls -- instead of adding pipes to the select(), it times out the select
 * after a set amount of time (right now, it's 100ms). That means that every
 * 100ms, select() returns and checks if any input is waiting on the pipes. Not
 * the greatest solution, but it isn't the greatest OS for networking stuff.
 *
 * Even worse, stdin is a special case. stdin can be read through a pipe, so
 * the polling code works great -- except that Windows won't echo types
 * characters unless stdin is being actively read. Rather than introducing a
 * 100ms-delay to everything types, that would probably make me even more
 * crazy, I created the Windows-specific function get_stdin_handle(). The first
 * time it's called, it creates a thread that reads from stdin and writes to a
 * pipe. That pipe can be added to select() and everything else works the same.
 * It's an ugly hack, I know, but when writing Ncat (http://nmap.org/ncat)
 * David Fifield came up with the same solution. Apparently, it's the best
 * we've got.
