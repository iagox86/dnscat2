 * This is a "tunnel driver" for DNS. What that means is, it converts data
 * on the wire - in this case, DNS packets - into a stream of bytes that
 * form the actual dnscat protocol.
 *
 * By abstracting out the 'tunnel protocol' from the dnscat protocol, it
 * makes it trivial to use the same program to tunnel over multiple different
 * protocols - DNS, ICMP, etc.
