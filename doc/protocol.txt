This document describes the dnscat2 protocol.

I'm referring to this protocol as the dnscat2 protocol, although,
strictly speaking, it's not specific to dnscat or DNS in any way.
Basically, I needed a protocol that could track logical connections over
multiple lower-level connections/datagrams/whatever that aren't
necessarily reliable and where bandwidth is extremely limited.

Because this is designed for dnscat, it is poll-based - that is, the
client sends a packet, and the server responds to it. The server can't
know where the client is or how to initiate a connection, so that's
taken into account.

This protocol is datagram-based, has 16-bit session_id values that can
track the connection over multiple lower level connections, and handles
lower-level dropped/duplicated/out-of-order packets.

Below, I give a few details on what's required to make this work, a
description of how connections work, some constants used in the
messages, and, finally, a breakdown of the messages themselves.

Although this protocol will work over any protocol, it's designed to
work over DNS, which has some interesting restrictions:
- Every message requires a response of some sort
- Retransmissions and drops and out-of-order packets are extremely
  common
- DNS is restricted to alphanumeric characters, and isn't necessarily
  case sensitive

For that reason, we take some special considerations.

The initial draft only supports TXT records. The request is always in
the form of:
- [encoded data].[domain]

Where [encoded data] is the packet, as described below, converted
directly to a hexadecimal representation, and [domain] is agreed upon in
advance through some channel.

The [encoded data] can be split across multiple fields, in the form of
"a.b.c.d". The periods should be simply ignored and discarded. The
official client endeavors to avoid splitting a byte across boundaries
(eg, "41.4141" is preferred to "414.141"), but the server supports it.

Each field (ie, the section between two periods) has a maximum length of
63, per the DNS spec, and the maximum total amount of data is 255 bytes.
All clients should respect that limitation, otherwise they won't work
across the Internet.

The [domain] can be any domain, and is discarded by the server before
proceeding.

The TXT response is simply the byte data, encoded in the agreed-upon
fashion. The maximum length of the TXT response, per the spec, is 255
bytes. Nothing else - domain, periods, etc - may be present, the
response is simply the data.

Future versions will allow CNAME, MX, A, AAAA, and other record types.
Currently, only TXT is supported it because it's the simplest.

| Connections |
+-------------+

These are all the problems I can think of that come up in a protocol
like this (this applies to SYN, MSG, or FIN packets):
- A request/response is dropped
- A request/response is repeated
- An old request/response arrives late

All of those need to be considered when handling the message types
below.

The concept of a connection is like a TCP connection. A connection is
denoted by a 16-bit SessionID value in the header. A client is designed
to deal with just a single session (usually), whereas the server is
expected to handle multiple simultaneous sessions.

A valid connection starts with the client sending a SYN to the server,
and the server responding to that SYN. From that point, until either
side sends a FIN (or an arbitrary timeout value is reached), the
connection is established.

A FIN terminates a connection, and out-of-connection packets (for
example, an unexpected SYN) are generally ignored.

A good connection looks like this:

 +----------------+
 | Client  Server |  [[ Good connection ]]
 +----------------+
 |  SYN -->  |    |
 |   |       v    |
 |   |  <-- SYN   |
 |   v       |    |
 |  MSG -->  |    |
 |   |       v    |
 |   |  <-- MSG   |
 |   v       |    |
 |  MSG -->  |    |
 |   |       v    |
 |   |  <-- MSG   |
 |  ...     ...   |
 |  ...     ...   |
 |  ...     ...   |
 |   |       |    |
 |   v       |    |
 |  FIN -->  |    |
 |           v    |
 |      <-- FIN   |
 +----------------+

If there's an error in the connection, the server will return a FIN:

 +----------------+
 | Client  Server |  [[ Error during connection ]]
 +----------------+
 |  SYN -->  |    |
 |   |       v    |
 |   |  <-- SYN   |
 |   v       |    |
 |  MSG -->  |    |
 |   |       v    |
 |   |  <-- MSG   |
 |   v       |    |
 |  MSG -->  |    |
 |   |       v    |
 |   |  <-- FIN   |
 |   v            |
 | (nil)          |
 +----------------+


If an unexpected MSG is received, the server will respond with an error
(FIN):

 +----------------+
 | Client  Server |  [[ Good connection ]]
 +----------------+
 |  MSG -->  |    |
 |   |       v    |
 |   |  <-- FIN   |
 |   v            |
 | (nil)          |
 +----------------+

If an unexpected FIN is received, the server will ignore it:

 +----------------+
 | Client  Server |  [[ Good connection ]]
 +----------------+
 |  FIN -->  |    |
 |           v    |
 |         (nil)  |
 +----------------+

Note:
- All fields are big endian.
- It is assumed that we know the length of the datagram; if we don't, a
  lower-level wrapper is required (eg, for TCP I prefix a 2-byte length
  header)

-----------------------
MESSAGE_TYPE_SYN [0x00]
-----------------------

- (uint16_t) packet_id
- (uint8_t)  message_type [0x00]
- (uint16_t) session_id
- (uint16_t) initial seq number
- (uint16_t) options
If OPT_NAME is set:
  - (ntstring) name
if OPT_DOWNLOAD or OPT_CHUNKED_DOWNLOAD is set:
  - (ntstring) filename

(Client to server)
- Each connection is initiated by a client sending a SYN containing a
  random session_id and random initial sequence number to the server as
  well as its requested options (no options are currently defined).
- If the client doesn't get a response, it should choose a new
  session_id before retransmitting
  - (this resolves a potential issue where a Server->Client SYN is lost,
    and the server thinks a session is running while the client doesn't)

- The following options are valid:
  - OPT_NAME - 0x01
    - Packet contains an additional field called the session name, which
      is a free-form field containing user-readable data
    - (ntstring) session_name
  - OPT_DOWNLOAD - 0x08
    - Packet contains an additional field for the filename to download
      from the server
    - Server should serve that file in place of stdin
    - Servers should *not* let users read arbitrary files, but rather
      make it up to the user to choose which files/folders to allow
  - CHUNKED_DOWNLOAD - 0x10
    - Packet contains the filename field, as specified in OPT_DOWNLOAD
    - Each MSG also contains an offset field
    - Each data chunk is exactly XXX bytes long

(Server to client)
- The server responds with its own SYN, containing its initial sequence
  number and its options.

(Notes)
- Both the session_id and initial sequence number should be randomized,
  not incremental or static or anything, to make connection-hijacking
  attacks more difficult (the two sequence numbers and the session_id
  give us approximately 48-bits of entropy per connection).
- packet_id should be different for each packet, and is entirely
  designed to prevent caching. Incremental is fine. The peer should
  ignore it.

(Error states)
- If a client doesn't receive a response to a SYN packet, it means
  either the request or response was dropped. The client can choose to
  re-send the SYN packet for the same session, or it can generate a new
  SYN packet or session.
- If a server receives a second SYN for the same session before it
  receives a MSG packet, it should respond as if it's valid (the
  response may have been lost).
- If a client or server receives a SYN for a connection during said
  connection, it should be silently discarded.

------------------------
MESSAGE_TYPE_MSG: [0x01]
------------------------

- (uint16_t) packet_id
- (uint8_t)  message_type [0x01]
- (uint16_t) session_id
- (variable) other fields, as defined by 'options'
- (byte[]) data

Variable fields
- (if OPT_CHUNKED_DOWNLOAD is enabled)
  - (uint32_t) chunk number
- (otherwiseFIN and close the connection.
- The client and server shouldn't increment their sequence numbers or
  their saved acknowledgement numbers until the other side has
  acknowledged the value in a response.
- packet_id should be different for each packet, and is entirely
  designed to prevent caching. Incremental is fine. The peer should
  ignore it.

(Command)
- If the SYN contained OPT_COMMAND, the 'data' field uses the command
  protocol. See command_protocol.txt.

------------------------
MESSAGE_TYPE_FIN: [0x02]
------------------------

- (uint16_t) packet_id
- (uint8_t)  message_type [0x02]
- (uint16_t) session_id
- (ntstring) reason
- (variable) other fields, as defined by 'options'

(Client to server)
- A client sends a FIN message to the server when it's completed its
  connection.

(Server to client)
- The server responds to a client's FIN with its own FIN.
- A server can also respond to a MSG with a FIN either when the
  connection has been cleanly terminated, or when there's an error in
  the connection.

(Out-of-state packets)
- Once a FIN has been sent, the client or server should no longer
  attempt to respond to anything from that connection.

(Notes)
- packet_id should be different for each packet, and is entirely
  designed to prevent caching. Incremental is fine. The peer should
  ignore it.

------------------------
MESSAGE_TYPE_PING: [0xFF]
------------------------

- (uint16_t) packet_id
- (uint8_t)  message_type [0xFF]
- (uint16_t) reserved
- (ntstring) data

(Notes)

The reserved field should be ignored. It's simply there to make it
easier to parse (since every other packet has a 24-bit header).

- packet_id should be different for each packet, and is entirely
  designed to prevent caching. Incremental is fine. The peer should
  ignore it.

(Client to server)
- A client can send a MESSAGE_TYPE_PING packet any time - before,
  during, or after a session.

(Server to client)
- The server can only respond to client ping, it can't send pings of its
  own out.
